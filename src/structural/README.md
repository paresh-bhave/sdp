## Structural design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

#### [Adapter](/src/structural/adapter)
Match interfaces of different classes

#### [Bridge](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/bridge)
Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

#### [Composite](/src/structural/composite)
A tree structure of simple and composite objects

#### [Decorator](/src/structural/decorator)
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

#### [Facade](/src/structural/facade)
A single class that represents an entire subsystem

#### [Flyweight](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/flyweight)
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

#### [Private Class Data](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/private_class_data)
Restricts accessor/mutator access

#### [Proxy](/src/structural/proxy)
An object representing another object
