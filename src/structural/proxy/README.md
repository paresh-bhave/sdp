## Proxy Pattern
An object representing another object

### Intent
- Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- Use an extra level of indirection to support distributed, controlled, or intelligent access.
- Add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from undue complexity.
