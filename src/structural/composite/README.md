## Composite Pattern
A tree structure of simple and composite objects

### Intent
- Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- Recursive composition
- "Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory."
- 1-to-many "has a" up the "is a" hierarchy
