## Command Pattern
Encapsulate a command request as an object

### Intent
- Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
- Promote "invocation of a method on an object" to full object status
- An object-oriented callback
