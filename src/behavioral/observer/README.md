## Observer Pattern
A way of notifying change to a number of classes

### Intent
- Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components in an Observer hierarchy.
- The "View" part of Model-View-Controller.
