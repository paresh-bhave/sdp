## Behavioral design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

#### [Chain of responsibility](/src/behavioral/chain-of-responsibility)
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

#### [Command](/src/behavioral/command)
Encapsulate a command request as an object

#### [Interpreter](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/interpreter)
A way to include language elements in a program

#### [Iterator](/src/behavioral/iterator)
Sequentially access the elements of a collection

#### [Mediator](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/mediator)
Defines simplified communication between classes

#### [Memento](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/memento)
Capture and restore an object's internal state

#### [Null Object](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/null_object)
Designed to act as a default value of an object

#### [Observer](/src/behavioral/observer)
A way of notifying change to a number of classes

#### [State](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/state)
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

#### [Strategy](/src/behavioral/strategy)
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

#### [Template method](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/template_method)
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

#### [Visitor](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/visitor)
Defines a new operation to a class without change
