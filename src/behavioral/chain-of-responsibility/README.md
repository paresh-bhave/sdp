## Chain of Responsibility Pattern
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

### Intent
- Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
- Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that contains many possible handlers.
- An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.
