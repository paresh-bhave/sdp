## Prototype Pattern
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

### Intent
- Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
- Co-opt one instance of a class for use as a breeder of all future instances.
- The `new` operator considered harmful.
