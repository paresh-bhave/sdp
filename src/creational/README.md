## Creational patterns
In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

#### [Singleton](/src/creational/singleton)
A class of which only a single instance can exist

#### [Prototype](/src/creational/prototype)
A fully initialised instance to be copied or cloned

#### [Abstract Factory](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/abstract_factory)
Creates an instance of several families of classes

#### [Builder](/src/creational/builder)
Separates object construction from its representation

#### [Factory Method](/src/creational/factory)
Creates an instance of several derived classes

#### [Object Pool](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/object_pool)
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
