## Factory Pattern
Creates an instance of several derived classes

### Intent
- Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- Defining a "virtual" constructor.
- The new operator considered harmful.
